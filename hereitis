# IDE Setup (Company Portal)
1. Open **Company Portal** on your work PC.
2. Search for **PyCharm Community** (or the approved IDE) and click **Install**.
3. Do **NOT** download installers from the web or run unsigned binaries.

## SAFE RUN OPTIONS
- Preferred: Open this script in a trusted notebook environment (e.g., corporate Jupyter or VS Code with notebook mode).
- If using the IDE, review code line-by-line before running. Look for network calls, file access, or suspicious subprocess usage.

> This stage intentionally demonstrates the risk of copy/paste execution.

    💥 BOOM (Simulated) 💥

    This was harmless. In the real world, blindly copy-pasting and executing unknown code
    could exfiltrate data, steal tokens, or encrypt files.

    ✅ Lesson:
    - Review code before executing.
    - Run unknown code in a sandbox or notebook with limited permissions.
    - Check for secrets usage and outbound calls.
